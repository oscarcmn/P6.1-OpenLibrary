# Library Web Application - Óscar Carmena & Ouafae Serroukh

![logo of the website we took our api from](https://openlibrary.org/static/images/openlibrary-logo-tighter.svg)

## Meets basic functions: data access, styled results display, and error checking.
We used the OpenLibrary's public API. Here´s the [link](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api) if you want to it chek out.

Here is how we tried to **check if the data was, in fact, in the API**. We got a rest archive so we can see the scrap that it makes.

We implemented an **error checking** in the search bar in case you try to search a void message. You should type somehing so it can let you make a search

## Performs searches with three or more parameters.
Our cards contain six parameters: title of the book, year it was released, author, the average rating given by the readers, the number of readers that rated the book and the number of pages.

## Implements two types of searches.
Our application actually has three type of searches: by author, by title and by both of them. Here we got a preview of how the website looks after we do the search:
**By title**

**By author**

**By both**

## Uses a private API.
We tried some GET on a rest file to see our private API

This is how it looks when we click on the Favourites button.
